/**
 * The following interface is basically a key -> object dict, with some additional features. First, each property is
 * associated with a "prop store" that includes the property value, whether it has changed since the last time it was
 * marked as processed, and potentially other info, like whether it should be inherited.
 *
 * Any accesses to a nonexistent property return undefined, and no property can have value undefined -- that's basically
 * the way such properties are treated. When a property is removed with .delete(name), however, the underlying
 * propStore is not immediately deleted; instead, the propStore has its value replaced with undefined, and its changed
 * value set to true, since the property has changed value, and must be processed appropriately before marking it as
 * not changed and deleting the store. With regards to any particular propName, an ElementProps object can 1. "have a
 * property propName with value propValue", 2. "be undefined", or 3. "be undefined AND have a propStore indicating its
 * value has changed."
 *
 * The meaning of whether a value has "changed" can be a bit hard to understand, not least because the same ElementProps object is used
 * for the element's defined properties and for its computed properties. In simplest terms, it represents that the
 * changed property must be processed when the element is updated. Take the example of a simple polyline, with given
 * vertices [v1, v2, ..., vn] as an array of Vec2s. Most of the polyline code prefers vertices in a canonical form
 * [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]. To prepare the polyline to be rendered, we need to provide the renderer with a
 * triangulation of the polyline's "thick" image. The triangulation is not only dependent on the vertices, but the
 * polyline's pen -- which defines things like line thickness, color, and presence of dashes.
 *
 * At element creation, all properties have changed: true, since they must all be processed; when adding an element to a
 * parent, it must inherit all the parent's properties as if they had changed: true. The inheritance algorithm is
 * simple: a parent may have computed properties with inherit: 1, which should be propagated down to all children
 * (regardless of whether they actually use the value). Examples of inherited properties include sceneDims (top-level
 * size of the scene), plotTransform, plotBoundingBox. The actual implementation of inheritance is left to the elements;
 * they could implement custom inheritance operations, or simply discard the inherited value.
 *
 * The obvious questions are: 1. why use a custom prop system like this? Why not just use static properties?
 * and 2. why use inheritance? Why not just tell each graph the plot and the scene it's in? Isn't that enough? Aren't
 * you massively overcomplicating things?
 *
 * 1) A custom prop system allows us to keep track of whether certain values have changed. It'd be foolish to not store
 * this information, and just recompute everything on each update. A single "needsUpdate" status could work, but still
 * discards a lot of information. As we'll see, knowing that only a few parameters have changed can be very useful,
 * especially with more aggressive caching, making updating significantly faster.
 *
 * 2) It's complicated, yes, but inheritance has multiple benefits. First, it allows us to keep track of changes which
 * can be optimized for in various implementations. Instead of changing the plot x transform and telling all the plots
 * "oh, something has changed, go figure it out for yourself", we can just tell it that the x transform has changed.
 * There is some cost for inheritance, of course, and in many cases the same benefit can be done via cachingâ€”which is
 * what will hopefully be done in *most* implementations.
 *
 * Suppose we change the vertices attribute, marking its property in the props object as "changed: true". (Note that if
 * we mutate the vertices array by ourselves, we have to manually mark it as changed.)
